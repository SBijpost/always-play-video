# Always Play Videos

Default behavior of Spotify is that you can select a song with a video, toggle to the video and it plays. 
When you then play another song that has a video, you have to toggle video mode again. I wanted to be able to switch between audio and video mode like on Youtube Music. So this extension accomplishes that.

This extension makes sure that if a song has a video, that it's played. 
This functionality can be toggled by the projector button on the playbar.
