# Always Play Video

Default behavior of Spotify is that you can select a song with a video, toggle to the video and it plays. 
When you then play another song that has a video, you have to toggle video mode again. I wanted to be able to switch between audio and video mode like on Youtube Music. So this extension accomplishes that. Turns out that it was pretty easy to do. 

This extension makes sure that if a song has a video, that it's played. This functionality can be toggled by the button on the playbar.

Will probably improve the button later.
